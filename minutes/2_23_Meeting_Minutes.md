    -   Thanks JT for handling it! Literally the most stressful event of
        > the semester.

        -   JT had a complaint: Assigning him as event host was very
            > last-minute.

        -   If this needs to be done in the future, let's make this
            > happen earlier.

    -   \+

        -   JT did well.

    -   Δ

        > good.

    -   Should we set up a facebook event? Have Michelle talk to him?

    -   We can reimburse him for things

-   Deep learning 3/2

    -   Aaaah.

    -   Aaaaaaahhhh.

    -   Eric's mostly got it ready.

-   SQL Workshop???

    -   No true workshop date. Maybe we can just have a private
        > recording.

-   Da Club 3/3

    -   Hack Tech is happening on that week. All the freshmen are going.

    -   Eh, we can go without the freshmen ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

-   Startup fair 3/8

    -   Startup Fair is happening soon!

-   SalesForce - CAP 3/6/17 5-8pm

    -   Eric has yet to record his ML workshop.

        > record that one?

-   Contracts

    -   Contracts???

    -   Make a "Term sheet" but not a "contract"

    -   Contracts scare away companies.

    -   Terminology is very, very important :c

    -   Letters of Intent are also useful.

-   Hackathon Sponsorship

    -   IBM??

    -   Don't ever call it a \<Company\> Hackathon :c

    -   We can let the company sponsoring it hold an infosession/tech
        > talk.

    -   Single-sponsor hackathon? "CSUA Hackathon With \<Company\>"?

    -   

-   Socials!

    -   Happening at Neil's and Megan's place?

    -   Totoro event? Not explicitly CSUA.

    -   Ghirardelli trip?? :D

    -   You guys should keep your Fridays open!

-   Officer Expectations

    -   Don't want to micromanage you guys.

    -   Please just let PB know whenever something comes up. If you
        > can't make to your OH because you're sick or something, just
        > let us know and it's fine.

    -   If you have something getting in the way of getting officer
        > points, also let us know.

    -   If you see things you want to do more for the club, just let us
        > know! We'd love your help on anything you're interseted in.

    -   Do you think our officer requirements are reasonable?

        -   Eric: I think they're too lenient. They're not involved
            > enough. "Oh, yeah, just come to three events and come to
            > your OH and stuff."

        -   Neil: We are a *social* club so it's hard to really require
            > a stricter presence for officers. Also, a few semester
            > ago, we didn't really have *any* requirements: "Does PB
            > trust you?"

        -   Megan: OH is quantifiable; points is quantifiable. Presence
            > isn't really quantifiable.

        -   Barak: Three points is pretty hard to get later on in the
            > semester...

        -   Eric: If you do something for the club, i.e. put up a
            > website, does that count for a point?

        -   Neil: PB is allowed to give out officer points for
            > extenuating circumstances.

        -   Caleb: Doing root stuff is pretty useful! Points for root.

        -   Mish: The points aren't really meant to be a 'get as many
            > points as possible' thing. No need to compete! We just put
            > it up to make sure you guys meet the bare minimum.

        -   Caleb: Just help out with the club, and you'll probably end
            > up doing more than "3 points" of work a month.

        -   Neil: The points were made so that you don't just come to
            > the office and play games and do nothing else. It's really
            > easy to get three points. We just want you to help out.

-   Alcohol policy

    -   Please don't be inebriated in the office.

        -   \@BerkeleyCSUA

        -   Make sure that your name is on it. Also make sure that the
            > description has the name of the object. And make sure that
            > the item cost is correct!

    -   Tell me about the money box. What goes on there, what happens if
        > someone gives you a \$10 bill.

        -   Any bill that is \$5 or greater goes into the money box
            > rather than just in the drawer.

        -   There should never be more than 7 \$1 bills outside the box.

    -   What if someone asks you to let them into Soda?

        -   Don't let them in. Just suggest that they can follow someone
