-   Qualcomm 10/7 5:30-8 CAP

    -   Woz access \@Barak

    -   Food, too.

    -   Pizza!

    -   Just got flyers for Qualcomm.

        -   Facebook is most effective, and often flyers come in barely
            > in time. Cutoff for flyer printing: 2 weeks before the
            > event.

        -   Impact of soda flyering is rather low.

-   Uber 10/12

    -   Also big event. More pizza? Ordering pizza next week

    -   Microsoft 2.0

    -   Email Uber about slides? Because they're such a large group

-   Blizzard 10/13 7-9PM in HP

    -   Situation: EA is at the same time.

    -   It's not very nice to EA to put signs in front of Woz :c

    -   Put up signs in front of HP!

    -   Move a table out from the CSUA for a table.

    -   Bring stuff up to the woz!

    -   Email networks guy for internet access.

    -   Motion to not bring up any computers.

        -   Why?

        -   Not worth the effort of taking everything apart,
            > reassembling, then having people use it up there, then
            > disassembling then reassembling.

            -   Then people don't put things together correctly so
                > things don't work :(

        -   More of a hassle than its worth.

    -   We won't bring up any ethernet, but we'll bring up switches and
        > allow some people to bring their own ethernet and connect.

    -   Or, should we bring up switches?

    -   Have Neil ask HKN tomorrow about bringing stuff up.

    -   Public event or closed-club?

        -   Ask Neil to clarify!

-   Also, office cleaning on 10/14

    -   Clean!!!

    -   Especially under the computers.

-   Nerdwallet 10/18 5-8 CAP

    -   Don't really need to plan yet.

    -   FB event should go up

-   Root Day 10/22

    -   Learn about root!!!

    -   FB event should *not* go up.

    -   Csua-newmembers email should go out.

-   GM \#2: 10/28!

-   Hackathon 11/4-11/5 5 PM

    -   More judges!!!

    -   \@Barak start thinking about food.

        -   (you should get costco pizza :D)

    -   Start with mini-tech talks, etc. Then dinner.

    -   No theme? Theme?

    -   People don't actually care that much about a nice-looking
        > theme..?

    -   But we should make a flyer!

    -   FB event up soon too.

-   Misc:

    -   Socials

        -   10/14 @ Sid's place. Kickback!

            -   That's the same day as the lan party :(

            -   Moved to 10/21 instead!

        -   Bowling social moved to a different weekend ??

        -   Or, bowling night on 10/15!

    -   Tech update

        -   Not too many things have happened yet. But Water's RAM is
            > fixed!

        -   Mead still has problems. Could be a graphics card issue?

            -   Do some bitcoin mining with the leftover graphics card!

        -   We have server room access! There are a few issues.

        -   Home directory not-being-chmod-ed is sorta fixed.
            > Everybody's accounts should be fixed now; they have to be
            > manually updated from time to time.

    -   Department Funding

        -   We got 1.8k from the department!

    -   Officer point update

        -   Now, one event out of 3 has to be from an event!

        -   Other two points can be from anything.

        -   Because we like to see everybody at events!

        -   Tossing out trash is like "lower value" than helping at
            > events.

        -   Getting a point from an event requires people to be there
            > for at least an hour; i.e. if you're there for 10 minutes
            > for setup, that doesn't count.

        -   At least 1 hour of attendance time? Even if signed up for a
            > time slot that is 2 hours long?

            -   Make it to our events and chill there for an hour!

        -   *Please please please* keep track of your own officer
            > points!

        -   We don't want to throw you away at the end of the month :(

        -   If you can't make it to 3 points (for some good reason), let
            > us know.

    -   Upgrading to win 10?

        -   Request to put Windows 10 on one of the six office
            > computers, so we can play Halo 5.

            -   Only for Halo 5??

        -   We could theoretically put it on one of the points.

            -   If we install it, we should do it on one of the three
                > computers without Linux.

        -   We can get a product key from the department, i.e. Cory or
            > ISG (or is it ISG? Just "the people in cory" -Austin)

            -   If we get it from the department, it's an OEM key so we
                > can put it on multiple computers.

            -   Installing an OS \*could\* wipe the computers.

        -   It seems worth "upgrading" one or two computers.

        -   Install Windows 10 on the computers that probably aren't
            > going to get replaced.

    -   Student Technology Fund

        -   New computers is useful! Because our computers are dying and
            > blue-screening :c

        -   Our servers aren't part of the department so it doesn't
            > really count as "core"??

            -   The OCF tried it, so we can try it too.

        -   \$3000 proposal for new desktops, \$2000 for server!

    -   Wellness Fee Proposal
