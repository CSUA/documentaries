        -   Or: Paper ballot; get a paper ballot handed to you by
            > checking in, then no name on that ballot. Anonymous.

        -   Nathan is trying to make an anonymous voting website.

        -   Get 7 pieces of paper, turn one in for each election with
            > the name you're voting for

        -   Lots of processes

        -   Better off left with an honor society than with a society
            > like us

        -   We'd be better off with CSUA shirts.

-   Office Hours

    -   It's hard to hold people accountable.

    -   Google form?

        -   Anybody can access.

        -   "Nobody was in the office at this time."

        -   We can check if people wanted to get in during someone's
            > office hours, but that officer wasn't there.

        -   Or, if there is a large amount of people trying to get in at
            > a specific time, we can get someone to move their office
            > hours to then.
