        -   Lots of people

        -   Uber people afterwards were pretty cool.

        -   Speaker was poor :(

        -   People just left. Speaker wasn't engaging; lackluster.

    -   The speaker was poor. Do we bring that up to Uber?

        -   Only if Uber asks for feedback...

        -   Don't just tell them straight in their face that it was
            > boring, but if they ask us, then we can tell them that it
            > needs to be more engaging.

    -   Δ

        -   Went through all the email chains; no discussion that the
            > event starts at 8.

        -   We think they messed up the time, then tried to cover for it
            > by saying that it started at 8? But HKN also told their
            > members that it started at 8.

        -   Massive miscommunication on their side.

        -   There was another event going on at the same time for HKN.

    -   Be explicit about asking for booking time vs start time?

    -   Board game night could pull more people?

        -   But LAN party has been a tradition between HKN and CSUA...

        -   Maybe we could change it to "Game night!" instead of only
            > LAN party

    -   \+

        -   Food was good.
