            > inclusive, I started hanging out here in first semester
            > but there were conflicts that caused me to not be here a
            > lot. I came here a lot more in second semester, and I like
            > the events you guys put out. Berkeley is missing clubs
            > like these, where you can just come in and relax."

        -   "There's a lot of issues on keeping officers on task and
            > etc, and I think I can help on that aspect because when I
