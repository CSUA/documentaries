    -   We can give sponsors a resume book!

    -   "Cisco CSUA Hackathon"?

    -   Neil will keep looking for a house

    -   

-   YT CHANNEL/WORKSHOPS

    -   YouTube is up!

-   Work delegation

    -   It hasn't been solidly written yet. That's why we still have
        > some troubles here.

-   Socials!

    -   Socials in Neil's place!!!

    -   But don't get big speakers. They will annoy the neighbors.

    -   LDAP is up!

-   Food @ Computers

    -   No food *on* or *above* the tables. It's okay if you sit back a
        > bit.

    -   Only water is allowed on the table, and the water has to be a
        > closed bottle.

-   How 2 run an event

    -   Say we have a Microsoft tech talk. Room is booked, they're CAP.

        -   CAP means they paid the dept lots of money so that they can
            > interview on campus. They can actively recruit!

        -   Otherwise, they cannot actively recruit. They can't say
            > "Give me your resume!!!"

        -   Woz is booked every day 5-8 for CAP events.

    -   Suppose our event is 6-7:30.

    -   So we need to start setting up at 5:30!

        -   Bring drinks, go talk to recruiters, etc.

    -   Food will usually get there around 5:50.

    -   Then make sure that people are standing by and are present.

    -   What if we're out of stock from the back for drinks?

        -   Bring a couple drinks from the fridge?

    -   Bring a few pallets (boxes) of water/soda.

    -   Ask company representative if they want to serve food before or
        > after event

        -   If people serve before the event, then some people just
            > leave right afterwards.

    -   Each event needs an event coordinator to talk to the company
        > about stuff.

    -   Serve food! Have gloves on. If not enough food then portion it
        > out.

    -   Then clean it up!

-   Venmo issue

    -   Water has been wiped :c no access to venmo for now.

    -   Must wait until treasurer\@csua is back up and running.
