    -   "Things are blowing up :( I'm sorry Caleb :(" -Megan

    -   Issue:

        -   People using our server to brute force into other servers
            > (like Columbia's), sending spam emails, etcetcetc.

        -   How were things compromised???

            -   Apparently Palestinians were logging in to our server.

            -   Server is very very very compromised.

        -   So we shut everything down.

    -   Priority of things that need to come up?

        -   Emails, then website.

    -   Password strength?

        -   You can put "password" as your password and the server will
            > let you.

            > strengths.

    -   We are going to be playing!

-   Socials! Kickbacks!

    -   More socials!

    -   But this requires that we have enough space for more socials.

    -   Space meaning time, not physical space.

        > fun...." -Neil

    -   For less sketchy stuff.. Board game nights! Movie nights! Maybe
        > an escape room!

        -   CSUA could subsidize escape room.

        -   Apparently HKN did some in the Woz?

        -   "I feel like an escape room by HKN isn't really worth
            > \$30..." -Neil

    -   Palo Alto Networks wants to do something fun with us? And pay
