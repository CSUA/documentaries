Sherry is making me do this against my will. :D

The concept of Woz Vegas is to have a General Meeting combined with a
casual casino night. Previous GMs have suffered from simply breaking off
into separate groups that made new members feel excluded.

We could run a play casino with candy as currency. Various games could
be run such as poker, roulette, and blackjack. We could have a fake bar.
At the end of GM adorable cute prizes could be awarded based on final
count of candy.

There will be two parts to this GM: the traditional core GM and the
casino phase. We could break out existing board games such as dominion
or avalon on several tables and let people play. Those less inclined can
go to the casino games.

2x Black Jack Tables

2x Poker Tables
