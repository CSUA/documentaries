-   \[Healthy\] Food

    -   Megan, Neil have not yet talked to the person who we need to
        > talk to about potentially selling healthier food.

-   Root

    -   Helped an alumni get access to his account!

    -   We're fronting money out of our own pockets for this, just so
        > that Caleb doesn't get sent another W-9 form.

    -   Caleb will be talking to Deepak tomorrow so maybe he can get
        > more information?

    -   Sid can help with fronting?

    -   Some form of slush loan for people fronting money.

    -   Officer points for helping with maintenance!

-   Funds

    -   We're a CS social club that's supposed to support undergrad
        > community

        -   We have lots of money but not really a place to use them

        -   Buying things for our office isn't actually that beneficial
            > for the community

    -   Yitz proposes that we help fund other clubs, kinda like ESC

        -   New clubs

        -   People doing projects that need funds

        -   Apply via a form & we decide whether or not we give them
            > money

    -   Sid thinks we should fix our office first before we spend money
        > on other clubs (e.g. TV)

    -   Caleb: skeptical, we put in effort for our own money, we should
        > save money for ourselves, very skeptical about who we give
        > money to

    -   Barak: before we give money away, make sure there's nothing we
        > have to spend money on in the office first, giving money away
        > is last priority

    -   Things we should fix: carpet, TV, microwave, sofa, etc.

    -   Neil: things that we fix won't cost \*that\* much

    -   Caleb: Sid won't be around forever, it's good that we have money
        > now but we won't always be this financially well off

    -   Neil: we might mess up, other clubs will be dependent on us
        > which is a lot of responsibility

    -   Yitz: we can get ASUC to fund this if we put this out well
        > enough, ESC doesn't reach out to enough small clubs or
        > projects

    -   Neil: how would a student who needs funding go about getting
        > money from us? How do we make sure money is used properly?

        -   Yitz: idea is still in the works, details aren't hashed out
            > yeet

        -   Sid: ESC reimburses receipts, doesn't give out blank checks

    -   Neil: this is a lot of responsibility, might need another
        > committee, too much responsibility for PB especially when we
        > are very busy

    -   Caleb: doesn't trust this system and would want to be very
        > involved

    -   Megan was on board, really wants to help general CS community

    -   Sid: Pay for a cluster set of computers?

    -   JT: No need to spend for something we can get for free. So get
        > that grant thing.

    -   Too many concerns here.

    -   Sid: What if we increase our presence? Put volunteers into the
        > department? Host more? Publicize our servers more? Workshop on
        > 'how to work with ASUC'? 'How to get your money back from
        > Deepak'?

        > money on it.

-   Mish's speech

    -   We've been having problems in general with discipline and people
        > disciplining each other.

    -   We're all officers/prosp. No one is above each other.

    -   Even if you're a freshman, you have the authority to tell PB
        > when they're breaking rules!

    -   And if you're PB, you're not above the rules.

    -   Don't be afraid to speak up. And don't be afraid to tell PB if
        > you feel like you're being targeted or something.

    -   Don't be afraid to stand up for things.

    -   If you don't feel that you can talk to another officer or a
        > member about their member, don't hesitate to private message
        > any of us or fill out our feedback form if you need it to be
        > private!

-   Be careful about cancer and circlejerking during business hours!
