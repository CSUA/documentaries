    -   our fault for not checking before hand

    -   a lot of people left right after the first three candidates

-   Not sure what to do:

    -   would we want to do more of a digital version of voting?

    -   is it necessary to do a re-vote for the first three positions?

        -   is it possible that there was enough valid votes that we
            > don't need to do all three over?

        -   We don't know exactly who voted, and we don't know the exact
            > number of votes

        -   Can't say for certain that any one of the first three
            > elections were not affected

        -   20 minutes for discussion, max

        -   all members must sign in before voting

            -   seat them at tables together so we can make sure
