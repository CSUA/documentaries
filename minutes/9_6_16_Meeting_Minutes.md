<!-- -->

-   Brian!!!

    -   UPE Web Dev chair.

    -   Staff member of OCF.

    -   "East Asian Union" but for EECS groups!

        -   Why do we need one? We already have ESC, ASUC, etc.

        -   If you go to EECS website and see the list of student orgs,
            > there are 17 total undergrad EECS groups.

        -   But those are only the officially recognized ones; there's
            > so many more.

        -   It's hard to book rooms...

        -   Lots of students need help with tutoring, advice, industry,
            > internships, aahhhhh

        -   We as a whole can do more to help bring EECS together!

        -   We'd like to create a collaborative culture:

            -   Use the influence of our orgs!

        -   Everyone who needs help can get help.

            -   Many people don't know about the tutoring services.

        -   Improved communication between the EECS groups as a whole.

        -   Modeled after things like EAU or others, like a conglomerate
            > club of clubs.

        -   Biweekly meetings with club officers, etc.

        -   Agenda focused. Got any issues? Etc.

        -   What can we provide?

            -   We'll get people together! More club collaboration.

            -   Get news of our events out to more people in a better
                > way

            -   Improved communication.

        -   We as EECS groups should be able to come together and come
            > up with a better action plan when things like Rao's thing
            > happen again.

    -   Size of EECS has grown to a point where our representation in
        > ESC alone doesn't cut it.

        -   From what we see, ESC doesn't quite add much value.

    -   How would a new EECS group add value to our club?

        -   Non-overlapping events, etc.

        -   General timeline of events! Synced calendars!

    -   What benefits would membership give?

        -   Event promotion!

            -   Collaborate with other clubs to promote things.

        -   Woz/HP reservations. Not sustainable as it is, even without
            > collaboration.

    -   One thing an EECS student council could do is to make reserving
        > outside space a lot more viable.

    -   Allocation of resources/representation:

        -   There needs to be some leadership. How does this happen?

        -   Council presidents from the clubs?

        -   Doesn't necessarily require presidents, but send up at least
            > one representative?

    -   Email:

        -   Bad timing. Right through classes. (right during 170)

        -   Hardware :c

    -   We have so many events, but some of them don't really have a

    -   They are getting very full. A lot of it is user files.

    -   Not all computers have SSDs. For those, we can install SSDs
        > along the hard drives

    -   For the ones that already do, we need to clear at least some of
        > the data off.

    -   The hard drives themselves are already full... because of other
        > things?

    -   Costco is selling 1 TB drives for \$100?

        -   (because now it's running on Apache, which has 'safety
            > features' and can't run as root :c)

    -   It can be manually fixed on a case by case basis.

-   Charlie Tian

    -   Hi Charlie!

    -   I'm Charlie. EECS, sophomore.

    -   Not really an active member before this, but attended a few
        > events and was here over the summer.

    -   Interested in CSUA bc in my freshman year, I didn't really get
        > involved in CS stuff, so now I'm getting more into it. Like
        > more interesting classes, but not just academics! Get more
        > involved, get connected.

-   JC Dy

    -   Intended CS, first year.

    -   I'm a first year!!! I've attended most of the events so far
        > though.

    -   I want to be an officer mostly bc I didn't really have many
        > clubs that I was interested in/related to stuff I did, and
        > this was one of the first clubs here that stood out. It's a
        > social club! That's important. Getting a community to start
        > off my four years here at Berkeley is important.

-   Loren

    -   CS major, third year.

    -   Did school, took time off, came back.

    -   Helped at Microsoft, set-up with EMC.

    -   I want to help support the CSUA! Answer the questions that
        > freshmen have when they wander in, and the community building
        > that happens at some events. There's a new focus on events
        > this semester and I want to help and support the community!

-   Blaire

    -   2nd year, CS

    -   It's my first day here and it's my first day knowing this club!

    -   I'm a photographer, I like pictures. I ran a lot of events; used
        > to work at citibank; did a social mixer thing.

    -   Why CSUA? Because I love CS people and stuff and I want to
        > participate!
