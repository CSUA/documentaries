GM\#1

Gaming ban would be extended until 8pm\....but this was a poorly
executed voting process. We should keep it until 5pm.

Jeff's proposal

First primary ban -\> Full screen videos or games, someone watching a
video on fullscreen is no better than gaming (this includes TV, Drama,
Movies). Any real time game should be banned.

Stipulations : if you made the game then you should be able to play it.

Rodney : We should not do things in the office that make it distracting
and unproductive. BAM. Thank you for saying it well, this is the main
goal, to make the office into a productive space between the hours of
9am-5pm

MOVIES, PLAYING GAMES, TV SHOWS =\> DON'T BE A HOZER. BE A GOOD
COMMUNITY MEMBER.

501C3 =\> Worth it or not? We need to commit to an organization, we need
a constant officer team, the IRS is going to keep high tabs on us.
