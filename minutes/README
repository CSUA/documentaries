These minutes are from the Google Drive. At some point in the past, CSUA moved
to using Google Drive. This has made it a bit harder to find meeting minutes,
since they aren't publicly available and indexed.

This is how to create these files:

- Download a ZIP file of the meeting minutes from Google drive
  - Use the "search" function and then download as zip

Use these commands:

find . -name \*.docx -exec pandoc {} -o {}.md;
find . | rename 's/ /_/g'
find . | rename 's/.docx.md$/.md/g'

However, there can be some complications dues to the way docx is handled.

So there's a way to fix it. Do this instead:

find . | rename 's/ /_/g'
find . | rename 's/.docx.md$/.md/g'
find . -name \*.docx -exec convert.sh {} {}.md;

contents of convert.sh:

#!/bin/bash

pandoc $1 -t html | sed 's/<\/\?blockquote>//' | pandoc -f html -t markdown | sed 's/\\@/@/' > $2


To search for something:

grep -R . -e troll

Use -B # for lines before, -A # for after, -C # for lines around
