These minutes are from the Google Drive. At some point in the past, CSUA moved
to using Google Drive. This has made it a bit harder to find meeting minutes,
since they aren't publicly available and indexed.

To generate these files, I (robertq[uitt]) did the following:

- Downloaded a ZIP file of the meeting minutes from Google drive

Used these commands:

find . -name \*.docx -exec pandoc {} -o {}.md;
find . | rename 's/ /_/g'
find . | rename 's/.docx.md$/.md/g'

To search for something:

grep -R . -e troll

Use -B # for lines before, -A # for after, -C # for lines around
