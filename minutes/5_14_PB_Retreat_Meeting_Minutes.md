-   Keeping track of office hours?

    -   Require that officer to be logged on in a computer.

    -   Stay logged in for the hour.

    -   Caleb? Is this possible?

    -   We could update csua.berkeley.edu/computers to say whos office

Constitution updates:

"Get more people to come."

-   Did we mean "public" or "officers"?

-   Officers:

    -   Event coordinator is in charge of checking who comes!

    -   Manual checking.

Want to make officers properly accountable. In office, at events.

Slack

-   Politburo-only channels.

-   Only issue:

    -   Neil, Megan, Julie don't get notifications.

    -   Emails for specific mentions of their names!

    -   Not many people will check slack necessarily

Servers:

-   Caleb has not bought server yet.

-   Caleb is planning on buying servers in early august so that it
    > arrives when Caleb is back.

-   Coming back week August 14th??? (not confirmed)

-   Extension ends.... Yesterday

    -   But it's not really an issue since the reason the servers needed
        > to be updated wasn't relevant for us.

Are spring officers still summer officers?

-   Yes.

-   Events aren't as required in the summer. Nor office hours.

Define officership outside of the constitution.

-   This will allow associate members (jeff, ana) to remain officers.

Calapalooza!!

-   Must be tabling. Should do.

-   We need a banner! And a tablecloth!

Computers are overheating. How do we fix?

-   Better heat sinks???

-   Would opening it and cleaning the dust help?

    -   Yes.

    -   Use canned air. Preferably with root staff around.

-   Would we be able to do that this coming week?

No work hours over the summer!

Business hours:

-   Conflicting ideas:

-   Dead week? Yes or no?

-   Third idea: Reduced business hours during dead week.

-   Dead week business hours: 10 AM - 5 PM.

-   Other times: Week days except for non-instructional and academic
    > holidays, 10 AM - 7 PM.

Sound level?

-   Traffic light? Or just a regular "SHUT THE FUCK UP" if people get
    > loud?

CSUA/HKN collaboration? Or, in general, external collaborations?

-   LaTeX workshop??

Emails need to be re-routed.

-   Caleb?

-   Done

CSUA... is kind of just a circlejerk.

-   Would be better if we could be a lot more inclusive.
