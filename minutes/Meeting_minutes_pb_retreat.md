Vision for next semester:

Things we did well this semester

same page culture/vision

members

pb cohesive

did our best on personal issues

Things that we need to improve on

HACKATHON

startup fair poorly run/not enough companies

seen as gaming club

lowers outside perception of club, which harms us as well as potentialy
precludes others from using us to their benefit

rebranding really with late night/tutoring, not so much companies since
awareness is already high

advertising/display

Improve membership involvement? core group is small relative to
membership body

Tutors

potentially separate role from Officer, maybe instead of earning OP they
just tutor.

CSUA is potentially successful because of how core/hardworking our PB is
and how work/requirements are more dense at top of leadership than
scattered at lower levels (Ex: HKN committees, etc). Potentially may
need to rethink this strategy if we scale, but for now working well.

What if tutor position w/o officer status? No door code etc. But, we
don\'t forsee this being a likely problem.

Culture/mission

not a gaming club \-- club that happens to have members that enjoy
gaming, but having \'gaming club\' precludes many people from getting
what they can out of the club.

Fall is the best time to fix the perception
