As you can probably tell, I seem to be enamored with Japanese aesthetics.
Ironic considering I barely have any Japanese heritage. If you ask me why
in person, I would probably go off on some b.s. about the distinct
balancing of traditions and new cultural attitudes, pacifism or something
like that. If I do, please stop me.
