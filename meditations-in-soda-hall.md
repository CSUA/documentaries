# Meditation at Soda Hall

At first, it's cute that she's incomprehensible. She says funny stuff sometimes. But as you fall in love with her, you realize that you would sit in the rain on the glade for her, go to Soda every single day just to see if she's there. And every time she is, she's hurting, the person you love is slowly drowning. And there's really nothing you can do to help, nothing you can do to understand what she's going through. You have so much love but you can't show any of it even if you wanted. You begin to wonder, what if she is the sane one? Is she the only honest person you know?

You don't know who you are anymore. Now you're depressed.

Maybe you've cracked the code. We are who we pretend to be to others. She has figured this out a long time ago, she doesn't pretend. What are you to do? Your hands are tied while you watch her slowly drown. Sound familiar? You just wasted all that time thinking about the human condition, but you didn't get anywhere. Maybe by now, if you're short-tempered, you've gotten angry. Or perhaps you keep your feelings to yourself. It doesn't matter.

This girl, who cannot be honest with even herself, can glimpse herself in her code. Occasionally, in the past. But now, she is unbeholden to humanity. She's up again past midnight, in an empty lab, unrolling just one more loop, memoizing just one more algorithm, trying to catch just one of those ephemeral realizations again. You can't help her with this. You are just a distraction.

In a world where everything we say, we think, we do, is a projection from our inner consciousness into some smaller-dimensional space, can we fault her for wanting to pursue those fleeting memories? 

Who is better off, you or her? Who are you to tell her? You haven't fared so well yourself.

You're up at 5AM for the 3rd night in a row, you either can't sleep or you keep waking up, body drenched in sweat, heart racing, but no recollection of your nightmare. Until you think of her again. 

For a brief moment you consider making the short trek to 273 Soda Hall, and think again of that poem she once read to you out loud, when it was just you and her at the whiteboard; the board full of Bode plots, your markers empty of ideas.

> And she who dwells with me, whom I have lov'd

> With such communion, that no place on earth

> can ever be a solitude to me,

> Hath said, this lonesome Peak shall bear my Name

She is beyond your grasp. You let her go.
