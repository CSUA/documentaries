The Jargon File
===============

This file contains various utterances and tales from the most despicable CS undergrad association on campus.

#### "Oh sh\*\*, hoser"

A term exclaimed upon hosering something, whether it's food, tech swag or any form of volunteary or involuntary handout.

#### Hoser

#### Server of many names

Sometime in 2016/2017, Sid Masih started work to get Nvidia to donate GPUs to the CSUA for use in a
computing cluster for undergraduates. After a long period of work, they arrived in late 2017. The
original names for the server, `smoothie` and `tesla`, were taken, and during GM 3 in fall 2017,
members were asked to propose names. Nithin Raghavan proposed `Maersk` after the shipping company of
the same name due to the fact that the computing server would run "containers". An abuse of root
staff privileges led to this being the official name for a few months until Robert Quitt suggested
`latte`. After a month of running as `latte` during it's development period, Mark Hill made a cron
job to change the server's name to a random word from `/usr/share/dict/words` every 3 hours, thereby
avoiding anymore naming discussions.

#### Blockchain

In late 2017, the cryptocurrency `Bitcoin` experienced a meteoric rise from a few thousand dollars
per bitcoin to well over 17000 dollars. This led to everyone and their mother investing in and
writing about bitcoin and blockchain technology as a whole. Some really stupid ideas related to
blockchain developed into startups during this time due to investor mania (as of summer 2018, this
is still happening). This led blockchain to be viewed as a buzzword technology, and as a result,
CSUA members began using the term as a joke. _IN PROGRESS_

From this, CSUA-Cash was born. _IN PROGRESS_
