As an officer, your responsibilities are:

-   Earn **at least 3 officer points** for each month in the semester.

-   Keep the office open during your [[office
    hours]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CtJUy0QdcrVktfMqcwAaTGB0tXBYtgdXZomNupH1NHE/edit#gid=0).
    Office hours are applicable on any instructional day.

-   Collect money from sales.

-   Enforce the rules of the office (Please see **additional office
    rules** section).

Perks of being a CSUA officer:

-   Officer tab

-   Office door code

-   Opportunity to go on end of semester CSUA Retreat!

-   Special networking opportunities and socials

Points:

-   Event, long event, cleaning, costco, tutoring, team duties

1.  Please be mindful of who enters the room! If someone looks lost, say
    hi :). If someone looks shady, discreetly notify other officers in
    the room and stay alert.

2.  If you're the last officer to leave the room, you must close the
    office. Ensure that the door key is locked inside the hanging
    lockbox in front of the door and the lights are off.

    a.  If there's anybody else in the room, you'll have to kick them
        out!

3.  When collecting physical cash, insert \$5, \$10, and \$20 bills into
    the locked moneybox in the money drawer. If you notice more than
    **\$7** in bills sitting loose in the money drawer, please insert
    the extra money into the locked money box.

4.  When collecting a Venmo payment, make sure you see the payer confirm
    the payment. This prevents Venmo fraud. (Our venmo
    is @BerkeleyCSUA)

    b.  Your name must be included in the payment description for
        authorization.

5.  Log your OH attendance and Tutoring attendance on the sheet in the
    back room.

6.  Keep the back room light off and the back door closed when not in
    use.

7.  If someone wants to borrow a charger from the back, exchange the
    charger for their student ID.

8.  Enforce business hours! They are 10 AM to 7 PM on every weekday
    except for academic holidays, unless otherwise noted.

Things we have issues with:

1.  Leaving the office open

    a.  Be sure that if the only officer in the room is leaving, you
        help them close up

    b.  Check to see that the door is locked

2.  Non-CSUA related events (e.g. wet socials, parts of retreat)

    c.  Don't post pictures of people without their consent

    d.  "Be courteous" - wet socials are not CSUA affiliated, and are
        not public

3\. Slack is internal!

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

Tentative strike/warning system:

1.  For officers at three strikes, your officership is at the discretion
    of the Politburo to rescind

2.  For more serious offenses, one strike is enough

    a.  e.g. Theft, physical confrontation/violence

    b.  Illegal things - violating the law, being inebriated in the
        office

3.  There is no way to lose a strike - strikes are permanent

4.  Strikes reset after the academic year (one cycle of a fall semester,
    spring semester, and summer semester)

5.  There will be a sheet to keep track of all members and their strikes

\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

Culture

1.  Someone (new) walks into the room!

2.  You hear cancerous talk in the office, and a newbie walks in

3.  An argument breaks out in the office

4.  You notice someone harassing someone else

5.  You notice an officer or pb member breaking a rule!

6.  Someone mentions that we are the league of legends club

\-\-\-\-\-\--
