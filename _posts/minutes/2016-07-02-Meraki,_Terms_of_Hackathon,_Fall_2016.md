**Terms of Meraki Hackathon Sponsorship, Fall 2016**

This is a term sheet made between Meraki and the UC Berkeley Computer
Science Undergraduate Association (CSUA). This document is **not** a
legally binding contract, but rather a consolidation of terms. The CSUA
thanks you for your support. Without companies like Meraki, we would not
be able to complete our mission of supporting the EECS and CS
undergraduate community.

**Date**: 11/4/2016 6 PM - 11/5/2016 3 PM, Wozniak Lounge - Soda Hall,
UC Berkeley

The responsibilities agreed upon by each party are as follows:

**Meraki:**

-   Pay \$4000 to CSUA through ASUC (check to "CSUA/ASUC")

-   Bring up to 5 company representatives

-   Bring 3 judges

-   Host an up-to-40 minute integrated info session

-   Provide posters or free swag for the event, at the discretion of
    Meraki

**CSUA:**

-   Provide catering services and snacks (dinner, breakfast, lunch,
    snacks)

-   Provide hackathon prizes

-   Social media publicity

-   Create, print, and distribute flyers

-   Room reservation

-   Oversee the event at all times

**CSUA Hackathon Sponsorship - Gold tier (November 4, 2016)**

**Description**: This long event is a time for students to hack together
on projects, which they will

present at the end of the event. Hackathons usually begin at the start
of the weekend (Friday

night) and end on the next day after lunch. Hackers code through the
night while provided

with foods, snacks, and energy drinks.

**Benefits**: Meraki will be able to view (and judge) hacks built by
students in order to view

talent at UC Berkeley. Additionally, Meraki has up to 40 minutes for an
integrated infosession, and can solicit student resumes.

The terms of this term sheet are contingent on the CSUA successfully
receiving payment from Meraki. Once again, thank you for working with
us.
