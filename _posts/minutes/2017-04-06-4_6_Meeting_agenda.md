    -   Δ

    -   More sponsors, less from each or less sponsors, more from each?

        -   More sponsors is more interesting...

        -   Less sponsors is probably more appealing to companies.

-   +/Δ GoDaddy,

    -   \+

    -   Δ

        -   Boring.

    -   They do this workshop every year. They don't really care about

    -   Δ

        -   Mish forgot to publish. But that's okay because people
            showed up anyway.

-   LAN 4/7

    -   Ready to go!

    -   Neil has talked to HKN/UPE to do things.

    -   They don't really respond or do things.

        -   We can't just create a Smash tournament on our side only.

        -   Plus we know who'll win anyway..

        -   Smash @ Berkeley has hella CRTs and consoles and stuff but
            looks like we're not going to be setting up a tournament.

-   Voting 4/10 - 4/12

    -   Contacted other clubs; they're not really participating.

    -   Monday will be okay, since we have lots of officer hours!

    -   Not sure about Tuesday or Wednesday

    -   It'll happen in the breezeway.

    -   Megan will contact UPE and HKN about getting more people!

-   VR + Arch 4/11

        -   Thai?

        -   Guac 61?

    -

-   Cal day! 4/22

-   Alum ~~BBQ~~ Lunch 4/23

    -   @Mish advertise to alumni again!

    -   @Caleb should ping the IRC channel again.

-   Retreat

    -   All ready.

-   Food

    -   We talked to Nicole about selling food.

        -   Essentially, she said that if we do it, and we do it well,
            she won't care.

    -   We do want to sell food!

    -   But it's kinda late in the semester.

    -   Maybe we can just do it next term.

    -   Want to prepare food ready for 11pm - 1am.

    -   New PB position?

        -   The person will essentially have to deal with lots of
            things. Getting deals with restaurants, getting schedules,
            etcetc.

        -   'Public Nutrition Secretary'

    -   Issues:

        -   Audience?

        -   Multiple semesters?

        -   Is it sustainable?

    -   In terms of what we care about, we gain a lot.

    -   We, as a club, don't gain anything.

    -   Once a week?

    -   Computer labs can't have food in them...

        -   But people already break this anyway.

    -   Logistics?

        -   How much food?

    -   We should have done a couple test runs this term.

    -   Imperfect produce?

        -   Selling that in the fridge is... not really viable (?) as
            it's not individually packaged.

    -   Test run a few times this term, then appoint a few people next
        term. And in two terms, we can make that a PB position.

-   Socials with other clubs

    -   HKN/U PE don't really commit....

        -   UPE is consistently useless.

        -   Let them know in the future exactly why we don't want to
            work with them in the future.

        -   HKN is at least somewhat useful.

    -   Can't really socialize with them.

    -   Socialize with SWE or FemTech or something?

-   Root

    -   New computers!

-   Funds

-   Couch

    -   How do we toss the old one?

    -   Call up the Berkeley bulk waste?

-   Prosps

    -   Danny

    -   Charlie
