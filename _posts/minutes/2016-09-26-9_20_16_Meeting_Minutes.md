        -   Budget crisis!

        -   The reason we were okay this semester is because we got 250k
            in private donations. Not sustainable.

        -   We could have covered more...?

        -   Though some people were confused.

        -   Solutions sometimes needed stuff that wasn't taught. More
            detail needed!

        -   Not very engaging :c

        -   Wild cards? Piping? Confusing :c

        -   "He talked about what they did and went to the next slide;
            didn't explain much what happened."

        -   People had trouble finding the slides.

            -   Get a better url for them.

    -   We should update them! It was rather hard to understand :c

    -   The CEO, after a lot of messages, wants an event.

    -   CEO has really high expectations of turnout.

    -   "Startup in China talk!"

        -   But this doesn't really match up.

    -   Sid told the CEO to "lower his expectations"\.....

    -   Get the CEO to send us a blurb!

    -   Then, we can actually have people know what the talk will be
        about.

        -   If someone tells you to stop, then stop playing.

    -   1 Hackathon per semester

        -   Two ideas!

                -   You make whatever you want to make!

                -   Judges like or don't.

                -   You hope you can hammer something out.

                -   We'll only have one. Other hackathons to go to;
                    people don't have enough ideas.

                -   

            -   Themed hackathon!

                -   Something similar to Intuit Hackathon.

                -   Don't have to be concrete ideas;

                -   We can have more people come!

                -   Has to be a broad theme.

                -   This will have to be okay with the companies.

                -   Themes that are okay with beginners?

        -   Too many hackathons going on right now. People make choices.

        -   We want a structure that works for a bunch of different
            themed hackathons!

        -   We want people to stay and make their project feel
            worthwhile.

        -   Or.....

            -   Sponsors donate ideas, and keep possibilities open?

        -   To have a themed hackathon, we'll have to talk to companies
            about it.

        -   Megan likes that it's general and that it's one per semester
            because it's something to look forward to!

        -   The joy of our hackathon is to do whatever you want.

            -   But then people bail!

            -   But also more people show up!
