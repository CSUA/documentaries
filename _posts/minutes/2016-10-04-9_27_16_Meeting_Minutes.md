        -   Our computers are dying :c

            -   Get new computers?

                -   We don't need full-out new computers. We can just
                    replace some of the hardware.

            -   We can really consider upgrading a lot of stuff, given
                our funds.

        -   Newuser bug still exists :(

        -   Server! Caleb has the money; he just needs to do it.

            go to the spiel now)

    -   Andres Guzman - Not here :c

    -   Parth Singhal

        -   Interacted with a lot of people! I feel better about the
            club and I feel like I can be a part of it.

    -   Victor Sun

        -   It's a warm environment, everyone is friendly C: We have
            social events! The social stuff is nice.

    -   Hong Jun Jeon - Not here :c

-   New prosps!

    -   Mong Ng

        -   Freshman, CS intended.

        -   2 main objectives to why I want to be a CS officer:

            -   It was so hot lately. Soda hall doesn't have a couch.
                There's a couch in the CSUA. Those couches are great!

            -   The cliche one. I want to more involved, and I would
                like to know where free food is.

        -   I want a PhD first before I watch a movie with some
            professor...

            -   There are only male professors... (it doesn't have to be
                a date actually)

            -   "If you had to go with them, it's a man-date!"

            -   @John Denero. Tell him the midterm was stupid and skip
                the date.

    -   Jonathan Tan

        -   Freshman, Intended CS

        -   Neil said, "Wait, aren't you a prosp?" \"What's a prosp?"

        -   It's a nice place to hang out and do work.

        -   I'd pick Denero as well, because I want to hear what he
            sounds like when he's screaming.

-   Rundown of Prosp process:

    -   This is your first meeting!

    -   You need 3 points this month.

    -   Put your name at some time slot for a event, or help out with
        office things!

    -   You'll come back in 4 weeks.

-   Megan's heard of slightly shit-talking things of other clubs, and we
    want to keep that out of our office. We want to set an example!

-   PB only

    -   Jeremy is officer now!

    -   Parth is officer now!

    -   Victor Sun is officer now!

-   Hard requirement of 1 point gained from an event.

-   We need to set someone to count officer tally points and see who
    came.

    -   Officers will need to come and talk to whoever that is.

-   We don't want to make exceptions to the 3-point rule...

    -   Ana, Juntai, Alex needs 3 points :c

-
