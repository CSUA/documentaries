    z.  Teaming with graduate student group to do this!

    a.  VR Tech is used lots in archeology, but lots of people don't

        about this specific usage of VR

19. **Uber/Women in CS**

    y.  PB made a decision that we don't want to host Uber.

    z.  Megan talked to HKN/UPE about extending this decision to them.
        HKN is currently discussing it; UPE declined.

        xvi. UPE: Though we don't like Uber's acts, it's technically our
            job to present Uber to the students. It's up to the students
            to avoid.

    a.  Even if we don't host Uber, Uber can talk to other student
        groups.

    b.  Politics....

    c.  We should talk to FemTech and host events with them!

        xvii. A mixer?

20. **Mission**

    d.  It's good to know that our general mission of our club is not to
        sign up as many people as possible - it's to serve the
        undergraduate CS groups.

    e.  Would rather beef up our own server than give money to others so
        that they can get a GPU

    f.  

21. **Prosps**

    g.  Jason Yeung

22. **Michelle's Speech Part II**

    h.  So last week, I talked about how everyone has a responsibility
        to uphold their officer duties, regardless of who you are and
        how old you are and how long you've been an officer, and ALSO to
        report things that are going on in the office, if someone has
        treated you badly, or if you see someone else treating someone
        else badly, or if you see yourself treating someone else
        badly... ... . .

    i.  Going off of that, I want to emphasize that the CSUA is a social
        club and I know that a lot of you are very good friends but I
        want you to maintain compassion for each other and still be nice
        (I feel like I'm talking to kindergarteners). All of us are
        smart people and we're all at Berkeley so don't make fun of
        people for being dumb. Always keep in mind that all of us are
        going through our own problems, and keep that in mind like if
        someone is having a bad day or someone says don't talk to them,
        respect their decisions. This is a daily reminder to be a good
        person!
