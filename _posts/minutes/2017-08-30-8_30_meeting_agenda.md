-   Welcome lunch +/Δ

    -   \+

        -   Good amount of food

        -   Nick Weaver's presence was good!

        -   And Charlene, too. And Nicole. And Barak Michener. And Lily.

        -   Ben came late, but officers were approachable!

        -   Professors were good to talk to.

    -   Δ

        -   Should have gotten a bit more food

            -   Maybe 2nds could have been delayed a bit

            -   Potentially reserve a few pizzas? So people who arrive
                late can still have pizzas?

        -   A few professors flaked :(

-   CSUA social +/Δ ("Board game night")

    -   \+

        -   The event was enjoyable!

    -   Δ

        -   Problem: The event appeared on our calendars, but no
            officers were there to make the event start.

        -   There was miscommunication on whether or not the event was
            happening.

        -   PB never confirmed the event.

            -   Anything that was public should be treated as a public
                event. This event happened to be on the calendar in
                public.

        -   All in all, the event could have gone better :( especially
            at the start.

-   FB 9/1

    -   Food is getting ordered; Ray is waiting for a call back.

        -   Ray doesn't have service?? :(

        -   Ordering from Ike's!

            -   Catering order is going through, but they're calling Ray
                back on payment and etc.

        -   If Ike's doesn't get back to us by tomorrow, we'll need to
            order something else.

    -   Event is public! FInal push from Emily to get it more well-known

    -   Volunteer sign-up sheet? Already posted.

-   GM1 9/1

    -   Directly after our FB event!

    -   8-11 PM

    -   King Dong

    -   Sign-up sheets for volunteering and stuff. We need people to be
        serving food and etc

    -   FB event is up, and is being pushed

-   Pinterest 9/6

    -   Possibly not happenig anymore??

    -   Not CAP; was supposed to be a workshop, but Pinterest is
        advertising as not. And thus it's being blocked.

-   Yelp 9/7

    -   Everything is handled! We just need to do publicity.

-   TBD 9/9?

    -   Professional Development workshop?? :D

    -   1-6 PM

        -   Drop-in any time? Casual/informal setup

    -   Resume workshop?

    -   We probably can't staff 1-6PM? =\\

    -   @Robert get IEEE on this as well?

    -   @Eric tell the officers about how to critique resumes and so on

-   Riot LAN 9/11

    -   Eric is following up with Berkeley Legends next week

    -   All we're doing is advertising

-   Riot tech talk 9/12

    -   Food is pizza @Ray

    -   Sibley is booked

        -   @Ray please document this process!

            -   Oh, he already did.

        -   @Megan tell \@Ray how to get the Sibley key.

-   Meraki 9/14

    -   We just need advertising and food

-   CS Intended Panel 9/28

    -   UPE

    -   People are stressed about stuff!

    -   This is our attempt to get people less stressed.

    -   Process of declaring? Resources to look for? Panel with Q&A?

    -   @Mish, \@Jason are interested in being on the panel.

    -   @Megan is making the presentation this week and sending it to
        Slack to check for goodness

-   Startup fair 10/24

    -   SD Hacks??

    -   Pauley Ballroom

        v-necks, more mediums!)

-   Engaging new recruits

    -   The social thing last week wasn't so good :( but it caught a few
        people!

    -   @Emily welcome email! Email pitch to new people.

    -   @Jason more socials?

    -   Megan: Get a lot of fire noodles and cook them and bring them to
        the CSUA!

    -   Teela: "Boba is good! Lots of people are interested in that."

    -   We can have membership separate from emails

    -   Maybe just have a straight mailing list?

        -   It already exists: mail.csua.berkeley.edu

        -   Maybe we should advertise this more

    -   A stand on Sproul?

        -   We've shot this down before because we think CS people are
            in Soda.

        -   But freshmen really spend all of their time in South
            Berkeley!

        -   "It's easier to reach out to people on a personal level?"

        -   Maybe we should try it out. Can't hurt too much.

        -   What do we want from tabling?

            -   More visibility.

            -   Q&A table.

            -   Flyers!

        -   @Megan will look into how to table.

    -   @Megan get more stickers.

    -   

-   Bi-monthly emails

    -   Twice a month, not once every two months!

    -   Emails are good for events.

    -   Email blast... today!

    -   (leave out pinterest)

-   Hack+

    -   "I asked him, but JT was playing Destiny" -Eric

    -   "Make a ticket!!!" -JT

-   HKN Collab?

    -   @Megan has yet to email HKN about getting closer

    -   Workshops, socials, LAN party, tutoring

    -   Just want our clubs to get closer together; collaborate on more
        things.

-   Branding

    -   New website, new logo, new flyers, etc

    -   @Megan ordered sheet things (?)

    -   The goal is to make CSUA events more visible as "CSUA Events"

    -   Make sure the new stickets have the new bear @Megan

    -   The new people in this room don't really like it :(

-   Officer training

    -   For officers to get more in touch with how to approach people!

    -   How to be friendly, and etc

-   Officer Cleaning

    -   Adnan's office note bank

    -   Having people take notes, and be stored in the note bank

    -   We'll just be hosting it?

-   Reclaiming the upper-div lounge (341A Soda)

    -   Megan emailed Cindy (who is like David Michael Sasson but isn't
        David Michael Sasson), and she said that's not true at all.

    -   Wat?

    -   Even Chris Hunn thought this was our room??

    -   Maybe we could just claim this room for tutoring

-   Workshops

    -   Workshops all booked, dates all finalized, except for
        professional workshop

    -   With the exception of prof workshop, every workshop has someone
        assigned

    -   Ensure Fall 2017 spreadsheet is up to date

    -   Also, update the calendar

    -   @Ray \@Jason

    -   HP Access? Jason knows how.

    -   When we put the FB events for the workshops up, put a little
        "workshop series" thing up too with links to the events!

-   Meeting length

    -   This meeting didn't do too badly!

    -   We're going to keep all the meetings under a minute. We'll try.

    -   Let's not get too off-topic.

-   NVidia Server

    -   Long story short, NVidia donated a large Tesla cluster to us, so
        we have lots of stuff for computations and deep learning and
        etc!

    -   Ideally revealing on AI day in late september.

    -   Any ideas on demos? Email @Sid!

    -   Maybe talk to BAIR about demo ideas?

-   Officership!

    -   We need officers!

    -   Website needs work

    -   indrel would like help

    -   Events also need help

    -   Officers do all of this!

    -   Requirement:

        -   Office hours once a week, where you keep the office open

            -   No other requirements, but just be welcoming!

        -   X numbers of points per month

            -   Maybe less points for freshmen? Would be more welcoming
                for freshmen to ease them in

            -   PB has yet to agree on this.

            -   Additional incentive for more points?

                -   PB doesn't want to make you feel like you're not
                    doing enough :( But we really need extra help for
                    stuff.

            -   How do you get points?

                -   helping out at events

                -   tutoring (1 point for each 1hour/week)

                -   Ray or Jason may award additional points for helping
                    out for extra long

                -   Tasks around the office (trash, recycling, cleaning)

        -   2nd year, CS

        -   Denero+Emoji Movie

    -   Ben Wu

        -   1st year EECS

        -   Got introduced to CSUA through the Discord chat, people left
            a good impression on me! It's a welcoming club.

        -   I've heard it's best to learn through teaching.

        -   Paco Burrito (?) (turns out it's Brito not burrito) + Her

    -   Teela Huff

        -   Freshman, CS

        -   CSUA makes a larger impact directly on CS, versus IEEE,
            which is such a general club. We're more specific!

        -   Want to make actual change in CS and CSUA is better for this
            than certain others

        -   Michael Cohen + Hidden Figures

    -   Daniel Wu

        -   Freshman, CS

        -   "I thought this seemed like a pretty fun place, and I went
            there, and it was a pretty fun place"

        -   "I have a lot of time and I want to do some nice things; not
            sure about the future"

        -   Denero + Snakes on a Plane

    -   Joshua Wang

        -   CS + music minor maybe

        -   CSUA was one of the first club I was exposed to! This club
            has good vibes

        -   Really big into organizing things and being a leader

        -   Denero+"I'll have to ask him"

    -   Neil Palleti

        -   Freshman, CS

        -   Met Eric, and he told me all about the CSUA. I want to be a
            part of it and have the resources!

        -   I want to help provide these resources and help my peers
            out.

        -   Sahai + Baby Driver or Mad Max

    -   Arthur Kazantsev

        -   Junior, Econ+CS

        -   "A lot of you know me as the video game prodigy as I am, but
            not many of you know me as a student... but that's because
            I'm not a good student" But CSUA inspired me to go back and
            do CS and it's the reason I call myself a double major. I've
            seen people come by the office and are super passionate
            about CS.

        -   I want to help people find this kind of community that CSUA
            gives and be a part of this.

        -   Rao on a date to see 500 Days of Summer and make dad jokes

    -   Starr Yang ★★★★★★★

        -   Freshman, CS

        -   Discord! Little freshman scared by the GPA cap; Eric Hou
            assured us that everything was okay.

        -   Want to contribute to the club + general CS community

        -   Denero + Shawshank Redemption

    -   Mark Hill

        -   Freshman EECS

        -   It's a cool club to come in and socialize, and I played
            Exploding Kittens here

        -   Perks are pretty good

        -   Frenkel + any Marvel movie

    -   Anna Brewer

        -   Now an officer!
