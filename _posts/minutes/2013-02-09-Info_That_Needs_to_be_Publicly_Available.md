CSUA is a public club. Following is a list of things that are in our
[[constitution]{.underline}](http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/?page_id=1115).

• General meetings must be advertised publicly at least one week in
advance.

• Proposals for constitutional amendments must be shared publicly at
least one week prior to voting; voting happens at the next GM.

• Elections really ought to be advertised publicly at least a week in
advance so members have the option to run for office.

• Our financial transactions, liabilities, and credits relating to the
CSUA need to be made available to the public upon request.

• If you vote to have a 'closed' politburo meeting, you must release the
general topics covered no later than 1 week after the meeting.

• Our constitution states minutes are to be taken at meetings but
doesn't state whether they be made publicly available, in practice a
secretive politburo creates a knowledge divide between officers and
politburo members that is unhealthy and unproductive for the club. In
the past we've had mutinies and flamewars arise due to miscommunication,
rumor, and misinformation. **Whenever possible, make your meetings as
open airy and welcoming as possible to the general membership.** We love
more members becoming involved!
