-   Also one round of food delivery.

-   Root

    -   DNS is all good now!

-   Funds

    -   All good too.

-   Tutoring

    -   Megan really wants to do this!

    -   We should do tutoring because the CS department is bloated and
        \"the only thing that scales with the number of undergrads is
        the number of undergrads\"

    -   HKN is overrun in their tutoring hours.

        -   In the past, we said it was HKN\'s thing.

        -   But now, they need help!

    -   Concerns

        -   Qualifications?

        -   Turning officers away for doing this?

    -   Solving those concerns:

        -   Not required. Highly encouraged if possible!

        -   Criterion: For the grades that you\'ll tutor in, you should
            have gotten at least a B+.

    -   We can put a list of the classes you can help out with on the
        website.

    -   Probably no officer points.

    -   Pros/Cons

        -   It is a larger liability for us than a benefit

        -   although it does help us fix our student relations!

    -   We should approach this carefully.

-   Office

    -   New stuff in the office!

    -   The couch is nice

    -   shelf is nice

    -   computers are nice

    -   microwave is nice

    -   tv is nice

-   Common Courtesy

    -   Please fill up the water boiler if you\'re done using it!

    -   Re-iteration: don\'t pour dumb things down the sink

-   Pusheen ++

    -   Who made it?

        -   JT!

-   Attitude

    -   There was a significant attitude change!

    -   Yaaayyyy!
